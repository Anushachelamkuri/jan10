1. College is expensive. Really expensive. And you can’t just figure in tuition, unless you’re considering a community college. You have to include dorms, meal plans, books, fees and more. We’re talking $30,000 to $60,000 per year!

2.  Graduation requirements are tougher. While you may be saving for four years of college, many schools have increased their graduation requirements so that five years is becoming the norm for some majors.

I actually learned this fact from my son Ryan, who is six years older the Katie. My husband and I about had a joint heart attack when Ryan, then a freshman at the University of Florida (Go Gators!) majoring in computer science, casually said something about what he’ll be focusing on “in my fifth year.” Wait, what???

3.  More girls go to college than boys. This is reflected in school populations where women are often the majority.

775,000 male students enroll in college each year; 1,575,000 female students enroll each year.

While it’s nice to see the gains women have made, unfortunately, it can mean preferential treatment for men. If two applicants are equal, and one applicant is female and the other male, the school will choose the male applicant to try to even out the campus population.

4. Campuses are impressive for a reason. The look of the campus and its facilities are big selling points for many colleges: hotel-like swimming pools, state-of-the-art fitness centers, restaurants, movie theaters, rock-climbing walls, game rooms, etc. Think resort features more than ivy-covered libraries and study halls.

5. Dorm rooms are still ugly. Although most dorm rooms are still small and unimpressive, they almost all include microwave ovens and fridges. They didn’t when I went to school. They have high-speed internet.
